                You will be able to access <a href="https://josephine.butlerjcr.com">the intranet</a> if you have already got a university email address and a CIS
                code (the abcd12 format code) to view more details, including contacts, but a snapshot
                is available at the <a href="/groups">student groups page</a>.
