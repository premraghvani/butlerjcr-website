        <!-- What to Expect -->
        <section>
            <h2>What to Expect</h2>
            <p>Freshers' Week is packed with events, introductions, and time to get settled. You'll meet the JCR exec,
                college staff, and fellow freshers. From BBQs to quizzes, and club nights to chill afternoons — there's
                something for everyone!</p>
        </section>

        <!-- What to Bring -->
        <section>
            <h2>What Should I Bring?</h2>
            <p>Here’s a quick checklist to help you settle in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bedding & kitchenware - you may be given the option for this</li>
                <li>Important documents. You will need your passport for registration (or UK Driving / Provisional Licence for domestic students), though a passport may be handy if you are finding jobs</li>
                <li>Any medication and prescriptions</li>
                <li>Fancy dress items - there'll be themes!</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Events -->
        <section>
            <h2>Freshers' Events</h2>
            <p>You'll receive a full schedule on arrival, but highlights include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Welcome Talks and Tours</li>
                <li>JCR Fair — join clubs and societies</li>
                <li>Butler Night Out</li>
                <li>Chill night with board games, tea & toast</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Throughout the year, many events are out there, some may be free, some may be subsidised for JCR members. If finance is an issue, do not worry as the JCR operates an access fund, and the college also has its own financial support.</p>

                There are societies and sports at a university level, but our college also has some of its own localised societies, sports, and committees.
                You will be able to access <a href="https://josephine.butlerjcr.com">the intranet</a> if you have already got a university email address and a CIS
                code (the abcd12 format code), but in the meanwhile, here is a snapshot of available societies:
