                    <p>
                        Fun fact, we own the mound. What first was a place where they put excavated dirt, and is now it's own little ecosystem,
                        which you can in fact climb to the top, and see the Durham cathedral!

                    <p>
                        We have four accomodation blocks, named after places of importance to Josephine Butler (the person);
                        Kirknewton, Dilston, Milfield, and Wooler. Undergraduate freshers are usually allocated to Dilston, Milfield, or Wooler,
                        whilst postgraduates and returners are allocated to Kirknewton and Dilston. Rooms tend to be very similar to each other,
                        except for some minor differences. You will be in a flat sharing a kitchen with 5 other people. All rooms
                        at the college are en-suite.

                    <h3>JBs (The Bar)</h3>
                    <p>
                        JBs is the largest college bar in Durham. Open termtime, from 7pm to 11pm (Sunday to Thursday), or 12am (Friday to Saturday), 
                        it serves a range of food (until 9:30pm) and drinks, including our college drinks (all colleges have these!), the Suffragist, 
                        the Butler Bomb, the Reformer, and the Butler Sunrise. 
                        JBs also hosts Freshers' Week events, post-formal entertainments, and other bar nights! 
                        It has two darts boards and three pool tables which are used by our pool and darts teams, 
                        but you can also make use of them when they're free! In the daytime, 
                        JBs is an excellent place to study, or to hang out with friends.

                        The JCR (for undergraduates), and MCR (for postgraduates and mature students) each have separate lounges, 
                        kitted out with sofas, boardgames, a TV with videogames, and much more! 
                        Some of our college societies and committees host their sessions in these rooms.

                        Our annual Butler Day is centered around this space with a big stage erected at one end, 
                        with the whole Butler community gathered on the lawn and watching live music and hanging out with friends 
                        (hopefully in the glorious sunshine).
